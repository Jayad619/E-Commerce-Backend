# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description

I need a back end for my e-commerce website that utilises the most up-to-date technologies for this application so that my business can compete with other e-commerce businesses.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API:

● WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

● WHEN I enter schema and seed command THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

● WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

● WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

● WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## Installation

run `npm install` in terminal to install the dependencies.
